App Name: Lst.io

Problem Statement: 1. Margaret, a NYC girl, moved to SF a few months ago and wants to find the best <blank> of SF but/because - Yelp and other ratings apps aren't helpful and ratings usually lie in the middle not clearly indicating of a place is great or terrible. This usually wastes time, money and energy. Margaret also gets really mad when she has a bad experience. 2. Margaret also has a really bad memory and forgets her favorites. When her friend asks her for recommendations, she never remembers. 

Solution Statement: 1. Create a valuable system where Margaret can share her favorites with friends and where Margaret can find favorites of her friends 2. Margaret can aggregate her favorite places and can refer to it when making recommendations or when traveling
